Our Java Project for the Norfolk-Cambrdige programme - Hangman Game.

Our Project is to created a classic hangman game. It involves guessing letters of a word before the man 'dies' due to too many incorrect guesses forming the gallows.

We aim to impliment random word generation that aims to ensure the user is guessing unique words every time, a system to guess characters in the word or the word itself, and using a GUI to keep track of incorrect guesses as the Hangman and the gallows are drawn. The game is over when the man is hung (fail) or when the user guesses the correct word. We would also like to impliment some kind of selection whether this is difficulty or catergory selection, possibly adjusting word length or obscurity, or imposing a time limit on the user, as well as having a point counter that counts number of wins and losses for the user.

So far implimented a basic run window based version of the game that works for 1 round, however doesn't really work when the word has spaces. This is not final and likely change when the game is made to work with a GUI. Also there is no Hangman that is drawn out at the moment, instead there is an incorrect guesses counter that ends the game when 7 incorrect guesses are made.
